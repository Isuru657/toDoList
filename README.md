# To Do List

This To Do List builds on version 1 of the todolist in my web development mini projects repo. This has a few addiotional features:

a) The app uses custom express route parameters to set up different todolist for different parts of your day (for example, Work, Gym schedule etc).

b) The entries are stored in an AWS cloud cluster on MongoDB Atlas.

c) The app is hosted on a heroku server (big transition from version one which was only available in the local server).

Really enjoying learning back end web development!

Hope you like this simple app!
